# Progress Labs Shopifiy Starter

This Shopify starter is a fork of UI Crooks. A quick nod to their team as it's an incredibly useful starter. Our goal with this version is to modify and update a few bits and pieces to make our life a little easier when it comes to authoring code in a consistent, clear and effective way.

## Features

Aside from the baseline features of UI Crooks we've included the following.

1. `plop` files to quickly generate templated code files for `Vue`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `Sections` and `Snippets`.
2. Included `Sass` out of the box for nesting features. A note, however, while Sass isn't falling out of favor our big reason for using it here is pre-compilation benefits of nesting, functions and interpolation. When this is enabled "out of the box" for CSS we'll remove Sass.
3. A new Vue component file structure removing the need for `render` and `renderless` directories. More on that here:
4. A library of commonly used modules ready to go.

## Getting Started

1. Use `npm` as your package management tool.
2. Run `npm i` to install all packages.
3. Run `shopify login [--store <DOMAIN>]`. [Review `login` docs](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/core-commands#login)

## To Do:

1. ~~Cart Functionality + Store~~
2. ~~Announcement Bar (toggle open/close)~~
3. ~~Klaviyo Newsletter Module - List ID is determines display~~
4. ~~Site Navigation (desktop)~~
5. ~~Carousel~~
6. ~~Progress Labs Credit Snippet~~
7. ~~Keen Slider](https://keen-slider.io/) integration (no longer using Flickity)~~
8. ~~Responsive Image Component (From Loisa codebase)~~
9.  ~~PDP Add To Cart - Basic~~
10. ~~PDP Add To Cart - With Options~~
11. PDP Add To Cart - Subscription
12. PDP Add To Cart - Sold Out / Notify Me
13. FAQ Page / Accordion Section
14. ~~Klaviyo Back In Stock Notification~~
15. ON HOLD [Pinia Migration](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) (vuex alternative) migration
16. ADA Compliant Mobile Menu
17. ADA Compliant Purchase Form
18. ~~Convert to Shopify CLI 3.0~~

## When To Choose Renderless vs Rendered Components

#### Renderless Components

- When a component is required to display initial content from the server for SEO
- When the functionality can be reused for other areas

#### Rendered Components

- When SEO does not matter.
- When component is initially out of view.
- When the element is not necessary for user experience. Example: Mini cart.

## Shopify Gotchas

#Math in liquid

Whole integer values will only return whole integers with math filters. If you are expecting a float you have to make sure one is a float.

Example:

`{{ 500 | divided_by: 660 }} = 0`

`{{ 500.0 | divided_by: 660.0 }} = 0.7575757575757576`

`{{ 500 | divided_by: 660.0 }} = 0.7575757575757576`
